- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm/yarn installed on your machine.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
- Expo CLI
  ```sh
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/MyApp.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install

   or if you use yarn
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the App

To run the app, run the following command in the project's root directory:

- `npm run ios` or `yarn ios`: Runs the app on the iOS simulator.
- `npm run web` or `yarn web`: Runs the app in a web browser.
- `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
- `npm run lint:fix` or `yarn lint:fix`: Lints the code and fixes auto-fixable issues.
